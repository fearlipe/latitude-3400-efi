# latitude-3400-efi
Opencore EFI for i5 8th gen Dell Latitude 3400 without dedicated GPU.<br>
This includes kexts for USB Adapters from chris1111 @ https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Adapter .<br>
Please remember to generate new SMBIOS, I recommend using OCAuxiliary Tools.<br>
Note that the Trackpad and WiFi is not working, still hasn't found a fix for that. I also recommend buying a native pci-e wifi adapter.<br>
